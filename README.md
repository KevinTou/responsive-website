# Portfolio Project

## The Objective

The objective of this project was to use basic HTML/CSS to create a responsive web page. There are a lot of things that could be added to the project, such as actual WP theme pages (which may be included in the future), additional working pages (i.e. contact, about, portfolio, and etc), and also images (along with related text). 

It would be possible to make the responsive design easier by using a framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, but I wanted to take a generic approach to it.
